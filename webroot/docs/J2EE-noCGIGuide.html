<h1>Setting up Pixenate on a J2EE server which doesn't support CGI</h1>

<p>If you would like to run Pixenate on a J2EE server which doesn't
  support CGI, please follow these steps...
</p>

<h2>Tomcat 6</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
	 In the <em>pixenate/cgi-extra/</em> directory there is a file called
	 pxn8.jsp. Copy this file to the <em>pixenate/</em> directory.
  </li>
  <li>
	 Open the <em>pixenate/pxn8.jsp</em> file in an editor and add the
	 following code at the top of the java block...
	 <pre><code>String script = "YOUR_ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_PXN8.PL_SCRIPT";</code></pre>
	 ... inserting your own absolute path to the pxn8.pl script. (see
	 examples for Sun App Server and Tomcat already provided in the source).
  </li>
  <li>
	 Change the <em>perlExe</em> String value to the absolute path to
	 perl on your machine. e.g. <em>"C:\\Perl\\bin\\perl.exe"</em>.
  </li>
  <li>
	 In your editor JSP page,
	 (e.g. <em>pixenate/themes/slick/index.jsp</em>) add the following javascript
	 code <em>before</em> the call to <em>PXN8.initialize()</em>...
	 <pre><code>PXN8.basename = "pxn8.jsp";</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
	 In a browser, visit the
	 URL <a href="http://localhost:8080/pixenate/pxn8.jsp">http://localhost:8080/pixenate/pxn8.jsp</a>.
	 (changing the servername, port and path to match your own
	 install). The output should look something like this...
	 <pre><code>{ "width" : -1, "status" : "ERROR", "opNumber" : 0, "errorMessage" : "No script supplied",...</code></pre>
	 ... if you get the following error message...
	 <pre><code>Unable to load server-side pixenate perl modules...</code></pre>
	 ... please refer to <a href="Installation-Guide.html#troubleshoot_modperl_iis6">Troublshooting</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
	 In a browser, visit your local editor page (the one you changed in
	 step 4) and try to edit a photo (e.g. rotate). The editor should
	 change the photo without problem.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Sun App Server 8</h2>
<p>The steps to setup Pixenate on Sun's App Server 8 are the same as
  Tomcat 6. You need to perform the following additional step...
</p>
<p>
  Change your domain's policy file (the policy file is found
  in <em>domains/${DOMAIN_NAME}/config/server.policy</em>) as follows... 
</p>
<p>
  Find the following line under the global grant statement ...
  <pre><code>	permission java.io.FilePermission       "<<ALL FILES>>", "read,write";</code></pre>
  ... and change it to ...
  <pre><code>	permission java.io.FilePermission       "<<ALL FILES>>", "read,write,execute";</code></pre>
  Restart the domain server so that the new permissions are granted.
